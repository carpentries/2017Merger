# RFC7: Lesson Organizations

STATUS: Open until October 6, 2017

## Current vision for Lesson Organizations:
* **Responsibilities of the Lesson Organizations:** 
  * Communication with Carpentries: Lesson Organizations will follow all policies as outlined by The Carpentries, 
  including regular reporting on activities.
  * Curriculum development: What is a workshop for the Lesson Organization?
  * Lesson maintenance: What is lesson life cycle (goals of lesson, when does it become supported, when is it retired), 
  maintaining lesson repositories in GitHub based on the lesson example from The Carpentries GitHub organization, 
  determining processes associated with lesson maintenance (recommendations for lesson incubation and maintenance?)
* Governance: Each lesson organization should have a point of contact (preferably a committee of 5-7 people led by a Chair), 
although the specific methods through which leadership occurs is determined by the lesson organization.
Onboarding for new lesson organizations: The Carpentries Board will be responsible for assessing alignment of the prospective 
lesson organization’s mission and their ability to meet the responsibilities described. Given these decisions impact 
organizational resources, the Board of Directors will solicit community input prior to deciding whether to extend an offer. 
The Carpentries Board may also recommended compatible administrative structures and policies for prospective Lesson 
Organizations.
* **Responsibilities of The Carpentries to Lesson Organizations** (please see [RFC1](RFCs/RFC1.md) for a description of responsibilities of The Carpentries in general):
  * Workshop coordination, including infrastructure
  * Lesson and workshop templates
  * Lesson development infrastructure
  * Assessment
  * Instructor training
  * Community support
